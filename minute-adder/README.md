# Minute Adder
This challenge consisted as an incomplete code sample where `MinuteAdder.addMinutes` function should be implemented.

# Problem Statement
> Without using any built-in date or time functions, 
> write a function or method that accepts two mandatory arguments: 
> the first argument is a 12-hour time string with the format 
> "[H]H:MM {AM|PM}", and the second argument is a (signed) integer. 
> The second argument is the number of minutes to add to the time of day 
> represented by the first argument. 
> The return value should be a string of the same format as the first argument. 
> For example, AddMinutes("9:13 AM", 200) would return "12:33 PM".

# Instructions
Fill in the implementation for `Main.scala` and `MinuteAdder.addMinutes`. 
Feel free to add whatever you need, but please leave the signature of `MinuteAdder.addMinutes` the same.

# Usage
To run the application using sbt, run the main class from the `impl` project: `impl/run "5:02 PM" 1`

# How to Test
To test the applications using sbt, call `test` from the root of the project.

# Work done 

The function `addMinutes` was implemented and test cases were added in order to test it by Luis Angel Montiel Moreno.
